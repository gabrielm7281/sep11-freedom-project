### What am I doing this year?
For this years Freedom Project, I am using Phaser(Add link) to create a Hollow Knight style game. I got this idea around the release of Silksong, which was really popular. I liked the idea of it and its gameplay and I wanted to recreate it on my own, but with changes such as certain gameplay elements and make it much easier than the regular series.

In the beginning of the year, there isnt much progress on the game itself, and it is more about expirementing with the different framworks that were availible to us. I decided on Phaser for its large platform and game focused code. I saw that there had also been multiple popular Steam games made with Phaser(at least Partially), and I found that really cool. Last year, I feel like my idea and Framework was kinda easy for the most part, so I decided to try and challenge myself this year. Phaser has a higher starting level, and making a quality game that I can really enjoy made it much more difficult for me and I think it will give me the challenge I want.
